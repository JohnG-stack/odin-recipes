        <h3>Description</h3> 
        <p>This <strong>pumpkin bread</strong> is a great old Maine recipe, <em>moist</em> and <em>spicy.</em>
            The bread actually tastes even better the day after it is baked. 
            It's easy to make and perfect for holiday gift giving! Pumpkin bread
            is actually incredibly easy to make, you don't even need an electric
            mixer (though, of course it helps). Simply <strong<em>combine your wet ingredients</em></strong>,
            then <strong><em>combine your dry ingredients</em></strong>, then combine them all together. Pour into two loaf pans.
            And thats it, the last thing to do is place it in the oven and your done! 
        </p>
