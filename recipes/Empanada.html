        <p>Delicious traditional <strong>Ecuadorian empanada</strong> filled with cheese & fried until crisp. 
        Empanada's are <em>crescent-shaped</em>, savory pastries made of dough and filled with a 
        variety of ingredients. Empanada filling varies greatly, and can include anything

        <!--This section of code demonstrates the recipe of the Empanada, and gives a brief introduction to this cuisine-->

        <p>
        Empanada filling ingredients vary from country, like in Puerto Rico you 
        might have one with ground beef, whereas in Mexico your empanada might 
        be filled with shredded chicken and corn. However, amidst all of this difference, there 
        are a few unifying factors. <strong><em>Empanada are basically little pockets of dough that are stuffed</em></strong>
        with anything really.
