        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <il> In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed.</il>
            <il>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape.
                 Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.</il>
            <il>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam for 15 minutes, 
                or until pork is cooked through.</il>
